# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Weather App

## Overview
The Weather App is a user-friendly application designed to provide weather forecasts based on user input. Users can specify their city and state. The app will fetch and display accurate weather data in a clear and concise format. The app will be developed using Next.js with TypeScript.

## Goals
- Allow users to input their location (city and state) and forecast preference.
- Provide accurate weather forecasts for the selected duration.
- Ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Features
### User Input:
- Prompt the user to enter:
  - City
  - State

### Weather Data Retrieval:
- Fetch weather data from OpenWeather API.
- Support the following forecast types:
  - Current weather (real-time conditions)
  - Hourly forecast (4-day forecast with hourly data)
  - Daily forecast (16-day forecast)
  - Climatic forecast (30-day forecast)

### Display Results:
- Show weather details such as:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
- Format results for easy readability.

### Error Handling:
- Handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent city/state).
- Display user-friendly error messages if the API fails or returns no data.

## Technical Requirements
### Frontend:
- Use Next.js with TypeScript for building the user interface.
- Create a form for user input and a results page for displaying weather data.

### Backend:
- Use Node.js to handle API requests to the weather service.
- Implement error handling and data formatting logic.
- Make sure hostname "openweathermap.org" is configured under images in `next.config.js`

### API Integration:
- Integrate with a weather API to fetch forecast data.
- Ensure API keys are securely stored.
- Use this openweather api key for this app -- OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=c99cc0cf008c04431230b61cef6181a4

### Docker:
- Use Docker for containerization to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.

## User Flow
1. User opens the app.
2. User is prompted to enter their city, state, and desired forecast duration.
3. User submits the form.
4. The app fetches weather data from the API.
5. The app displays the weather forecast or an error message if applicable.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Ensure the app responds to user input and displays results within 2 seconds.
- **Scalability:** Design the app to handle multiple concurrent users.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader support).

## Milestones
1. Set up the Next.js project and Docker environment.
2. Implement the user input form.
3. Integrate with the weather API.
4. Display weather data based on user input.
5. Add error handling and polish the UI.
